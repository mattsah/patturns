PATTURNS
=====

A silly little pattern library.

This thing uses local storage, ace editor, and some more modern CSS and JS,
in order to do some super quick pattern hacking.

You can write HTML, CSS, view the result, and then save your pattern to
local storage for later.

**NOTE: There's currently a bug where hitting ctrl+s over the result will
not save because you're over a different document/window.  IN ORDER TO
SAVE YOU MUST HIT CTRL+S OVER ANOTHER AREA**
